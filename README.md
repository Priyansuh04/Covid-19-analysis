## Task: Understanding Suicide data for Mental Health Analysis

For this task, I worked with a real-world COVID-19 dataset containing information about confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing data from many countries across different years. The main objective of this task was to understand what the dataset represents and what kind of real-life problems it can help us study.
The dataset contains information such as country/region, date, total confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered cases, active cases, and other relevant indicators..

**Dataset Source:**
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MainakRepositor/Datasets/master/covid_19_india.csv

## Why i chose this dataset

I chose this dataset because COVID-19 had a major impact on global health and economies. Analyzing this type of data can help us understand how the virus spread, which countries were most affected, and how effective different control measures were. It also supports decision-making for public health planning and awareness

## What this data can help us find

Using this dataset, we can try to answer questions such as:

- Which countries had the highest number of COVID-19 cases?
- How did confirmed cases and deaths change over time?
- Which countries had higher recovery rates?
- What was the trend of active cases during different periods?

## Goal of this task

> To understand the COVID-19 dataset and its real-world meaning, and to define what kind of analysis we want to perform.

## What i have learned from this task

- How to interpret a dataset in a real-world context.
- How to understand the background and purpose of a dataset.
- The importance of defining clear objectives before starting analysis.
